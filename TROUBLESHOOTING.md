# Troubleshooting #

## Keyboard ##

**Cursor does not move, instead keys are typed:** Example, **SYM+D** types **d** rather than moving cursor right. 
**Root Cause:** Keyboard ribbon is not seated perfectly
**Resolution:** Remove faceplate, re-seat keyboard ribbon carefully. Test. Re-attach faceplate.
